You could install the released version of r3dmol from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("r3dmol")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("swsoyee/r3dmol")
```

## Example

``` r
library(r3dmol)

r3dmol(                         # Set up the initial viewer
  viewer_spec = m_viewer_spec(
    cartoonQuality = 10,
    lowerZoomLimit = 50,
    upperZoomLimit = 350
  )
) %>%
  m_add_model(                  # Add model to scene
    data = pdb_6zsl,
    format = "pdb"
  ) %>%
  m_zoom_to() %>%               # Zoom to encompass the whole scene
  m_set_style(                  # Set style of structures
    style = m_style_cartoon(
      color = "#00cc96"
    )
  ) %>%
  m_set_style(                  # Set style of specific selection
    sel = m_sel(ss = "s"),      # (selecting by secondary)
    style = m_style_cartoon(
      color = "#636efa",
      arrows = TRUE
    )
  ) %>%
  m_set_style(                  # Style the alpha helix
    sel = m_sel(ss = "h"),      # (selecting by alpha helix)
    style = m_style_cartoon(
      color = "#ff7f0e"
    )
  ) %>%
  m_rotate(                     # Rotate the scene by given angle on given axis
    angle = 90,
    axis = "y"
  ) %>%
  m_spin()                      # Animate the scene by spinning it
```
